These examples show how you can use text-bags with the Reuters Corpus
using a simple tokenising/bagging utility called linkBags.

Reuters stopped distributing the corpus in 2004. 
Instead, the Reuters corpus is now available from NIST, the 
National Institute of Science and Technology. 

The Reuters news items are in NewsML, an XML format, with one
file per item.   So an XSLT extractor is supplied here.
To create input for the linkBags suite, do something like this:
	xsltproc reuters.xsl batch1/*.xml > rtrs.links
	xsltproc reuters.xsl batch2/*.xml >> rtrs.links
	...
Probably best do in batches and concatenate the files.

We then proceed with the usual use of linkBags:

#  prepare symbol tables in the file stem "rtrs"
#  using stopwords, and exclude tokens with less than 30 count
linkTables --stopfile ../starthere/stops.txt --mincount 30 --stemming rtrs.links rtrs

#  build bags in the stem rtrs
linkBags --ldac rtrs.links rtrs
