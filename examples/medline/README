These examples show how you can use text-bags with PubMed Abstracts as
obtained from U.S. National Library of Medicine. 

PubMed files are in XML with DTDs and format descriptions at their
website.   So an XSLT extractor is supplied here.
This XSLT script is not extensively tested so may not
work for unusual publication types.
To create input for the linkBags suite, do something like this:
	zcat medline09n0001.xml.gz | xsltproc medline.xsl - > mdl.links
	zcat medline09n0002.xml.gz | xsltproc medline.xsl - >> mdl.links
	...
Probably best do in batches and concatenate the files.
PubMed files are just the right size (30Mb) to run xsltproc on.

Note there are a lot of PubMed abstracts, so you will have to select a subset
you want to work with.
	
We proceed with the usual use of linkBags:

#  prepare symbol tables in the file stem "mdl"
#  using stopwords, and exclude tokens with less than 30 count
linkTables --stopfile ../starthere/stops.txt --mincount 30 --stemming mdl.links mdl

#  build bags in the stem mdl
linkBags mdl.links mdl
